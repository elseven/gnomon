schoolselect prefab should have a script for deleting itself with the delete button so that when spawned, already working



DELETE school should delete everything associated with it. not just the one dropdown...
	Script should be attached to things to be deleted? not things with delete buttons?
	Just attach delete scripts to entire block instead of dropdown thing?


•Delete button
	•School w/in community
•Add school button
	•Add school to "ByCommunity"
	•...
•Drop down changes panels for "Compare by"




Questions:
•When does search get cleared?
	•When you leave tab? When you leave app?
